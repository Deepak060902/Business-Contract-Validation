Introduction
Business contracts are complex legal documents that require thorough review and analysis. Manual review is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. This project aims to automate the contract validation process using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

Features
Automated Contract Parsing and Structuring
Clause Classification using Machine Learning
Template Deviation Detection and Highlighting
Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Key Contract Details
Summary Generation for Quick Contract Overview
User-friendly Interface for Contract Upload and Result Display
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Deepak060902/Business-Contract-Validation.git
cd Business-Contract-Validation
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database (MongoDB/MySQL) and update the configuration in the project.
Usage
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Access the frontend interface (assuming it's served by a different service, update accordingly).

Upload contract documents through the interface and view the analysis results.
